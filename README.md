SugarGuard V1 and V2 sources both leaked to tease people who sells it.

# About
Yes, I leaked it. I am proud with myself. I want to everything be free. Some people cracks programs and sells them. And some people like @Yeetret (https://github.com/Yeetret). I finally got it from somewhere not your bussines and leaked it on github. I know already some people leaked it, but they leaked just v2, not v1. And finally I know some people from Reverse X will swear me and try to threat/treat me.
