# SugarGuard Source Leak
SugarGuard V1 and V2 sources both leaked to tease people who sells it.

# Building
If it gives erros, try to build again, lol.

# About
Yes, I leaked it. I am proud with myself. I want to everything be free. I am bored in home and wanted to annoy @Yeetret (https://github.com/Yeetret) who sells the source. I finally got it from somewhere not your bussines and leaked it on github. I know already some people leaked it, but they leaked just v2, not v1. And finally I know some people from Reverse X will swear me and try to threat/treat me.
